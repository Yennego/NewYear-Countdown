🎆 WATCHNIGHT 2025 – VISUAL & TECH PLAN
Theme: “CROSSING OVER”

From One Year Into Another by the Grace of God

🧭 OVERALL GOAL

To transform the New Year countdown from a simple timer into a spiritual, visual journey that:

Prepares hearts

Builds anticipation

Honors the sacred moment of midnight

Looks excellent on projector screens and livestream platforms (Facebook, YouTube, etc.)

🕰️ PHASE 1 — WAITING ROOM (Before 11:00 PM)
🎯 Purpose

Create a calm, reflective atmosphere while waiting for the countdown window to begin.

🎨 Visual Direction

Slow animated gradient background (deep blue → black → subtle gold)

Gentle floating particles (light, dust-like)

Church logo watermark (low opacity, bottom-center)

✝️ Scripture & Message Rotation (Updated)

Displayed one at a time, fading softly:

“Ebenezer — Thus far the Lord has helped us.”
1 Samuel 7:12

“The same God who brought you through this year will carry you into the next.”

“Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth.”
Isaiah 43:19

“We are standing on the threshold of a new season.”

🛠 Tech Notes

Framer Motion: fade + slight scale (1.02 → 1)

Tailwind for typography consistency

No sharp movements

⏳ PHASE 2 — COUNTDOWN AWAKENING (11:00 PM – 11:55 PM)
🎯 Purpose

Shift attention from waiting to expectation.

🎨 Visual Direction

Countdown appears with smooth entrance

Time units animate upward subtly

Circular or radial progress indicator replaces flat bar

🕒 Countdown Label Text (Updated)

“Counting Down to a New Beginning”

✨ Enhancements

Numbers morph smoothly instead of snapping

Minute changes trigger a soft glow pulse

Background slightly brightens as midnight approaches

🛠 Tech Notes

Framer Motion layout animations

SVG circular progress synced to seconds

Tailwind gradients (gold accents introduced subtly)

🔥 PHASE 3 — FINAL 60 SECONDS (THE SACRED MOMENT)
🎯 Purpose

This is the holiest moment — silence, prayer, expectation.

🎨 Visual Direction

Background darkens

Countdown zooms slightly

Soft pulse like a heartbeat

⏱️ Prophetic Word Reveal (Updated)

Each second briefly reveals a word behind the number:

Second	Word
10	FAITH
9	HOPE
8	GRACE
7	MERCY
6	FAVOR
5	POWER
4	JOY
3	PEACE
2	THANKSGIVING
1	PRAISE

No music. Let the congregation lead.

🛠 Tech Notes

GSAP Timeline (recommended here for precision)

Framer Motion variants if GSAP is skipped

Text opacity + blur reveal

🎆 PHASE 4 — MIDNIGHT MOMENT (00:00:00)
🎯 Purpose

Celebrate the crossing-over moment with excellence and reverence.

🎨 Visual Direction

Screen flashes white → gold

Fireworks burst (gold & white only)

Light rays expanding outward
